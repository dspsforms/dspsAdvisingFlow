# DSPS Advising Flow

DSPS Advising Flow is a forms-based workflow system for DSPS departments. Typically, 
department faculty and staff approve various Accommodations for students. Students may need to sign
some of these. Managing such forms, keeping a record for legal/audit purposes, etc. is what this web-based
application implements.

A second web application provides a way for students to submit information (such as intake form, alternate-media request, etc.). Please check out the repository "dspsForms" under this same account for documentation and source code.

# Rapid, low friction deployment

Typically, systems such as this has a long implementation cycle. One issue that take time is getting
all legal users on-board. We have taken an approach that will help you rapidly onboard your students. 

For the Advising module, students can sign up on their own. Department faculty and staff accounts are created 
by someone with admin priviledges to the web application. Additionally, faculty can create accommodation forms for 
students who have not yet signed up. 

These are, obviously, tradeoffs. We decided on this design because otherwise, it can take a long time to 
co-ordinate student lists etc.
