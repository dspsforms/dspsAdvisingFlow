# DSPS Advising Flow

DSPS Advising Flow is a forms-based workflow system for DSPS departments. Typically, 
department faculty and staff approve various Accommodations for students. Students may need to sign
some of these. Managing such forms, keeping a record for legal/audit purposes, etc. is what this web-based
application implements.

A second web application provides a way for students to submit information (such as intake form, alternate-media request, etc.). Please check out the repository "dspsForms" under this same account for documentation and source code.
